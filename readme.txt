**Third Party Services**
This plugin relies on Google Fonts API for allowing using those fonts in your block editor. When end users visit a website that embeds Google Fonts, their browsers send HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API. The Google Fonts Web API serves the Google Fonts Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and subsequently the font files specified in the CSS to the users. Such HTTP requests include

(1) The IP address used by the respective user to access the Internet
(2) the requested URL on the Google server
(3) HTTP headers including the user agent describing the website visitorsâ€™ Internet browser and operating system versions as well as the referer (i.e. the webpage on which the Google font is to be displayed).

Terms of Service: https://developers.google.com/fonts/terms
